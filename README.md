This app allows users to listen to random songs using the React Youtube NPM. I wanted to test out how to play YT Videos on my site and I chose to randomize all of Mac Miller's songs from his youtube videos. Clicking on the center of the circle chooses a random song and plays the corresponding video. Hovering or clicking on an album displays the tracklist from that album and users can then select a specific song from that album rather than a random song. The site is mobile responsive and works for large screen users all the way to phone users.

I also decided to purchase a custom url for this site and the app can be found at randommac.com.
